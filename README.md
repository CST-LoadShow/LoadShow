# LoadShow
Artifacts for "LoadShow: Application Fingerprinting Based on the Combined Characteristics of CPU and GPU".

## Demo Videos
We evaluate LoadShow in the real world, demonstrating its ability to remotely recognize applications and their in-app actions.

For most applications, the total time required for LoadShow to collect one CPU and one GPU timing data is 28 to 30 seconds.
